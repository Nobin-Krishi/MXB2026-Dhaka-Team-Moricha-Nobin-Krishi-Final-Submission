# 🌾 NobinKrishi (নবীন কৃষি)
### Smart Agriculture Platform for Bangladesh

---

## 📖 What is NobinKrishi?

**NobinKrishi** means "New Agriculture" in Bangla. It's a smart farming platform that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to help farmers grow better crops, earn more money, and connect directly with people who want to buy their produce.

Think of it as a **helpful farming assistant** that lives on your smartphone, available 24/7 to answer questions, give advice, and connect you with buyers.

---

## 🎯 Our Mission

**To make farming easier, more profitable, and sustainable by bringing modern technology to every farmer in Bangladesh and other countries.**

We believe every farmer deserves:
- ✅ Fair prices for their hard work
- ✅ Access to expert knowledge
- ✅ Tools to grow healthier crops
- ✅ Direct connections to buyers (no middlemen!)
- ✅ Protection from crop diseases and weather problems

---

## 🌟 Main Features (What Can NobinKrishi Do?)


### 1. 🤝 Smart Marketplace - Connect Farmers & Buyers

<img width="1365" height="945" alt="localhost_8080_marketplace (1)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea7b034d-82ae-4b30-b6fe-6981c1f7c65f" />
Prevent Food Waste By Buying Imperfect Food At 40% Low Price Still Delicious.

**What it does:**
Automatically matches farmers with nearby customers who need exactly what they're growing.

<img width="1357" height="1620" alt="localhosst_8080_marketplace" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7fce01a3-44d2-4ac2-93f3-9eb3d130d75d" />

**How it works:**
- **For Farmers:** You list what crops you have (example: 50 kg tomatoes, 100 kg rice)
- **For Customers:** You tell us what you need (example: "I need 10 kg fresh tomatoes")
- **AI Magic:** Our system automatically finds the nearest farmer who has what you need and connects you both

**Benefits:**
- 🚫 **No middlemen** taking your profits
- 💰 **Farmers earn 40-60% more** because they sell directly
- 🛒 **Customers pay 72% less** than supermarket prices
- 🚚 **Fresh produce** delivered within 24 hours
- 📍 **Local connections** - find farmers near you

**Example:**
```
Rahim (Farmer in Mymensingh) grows tomatoes
    ↓
AI matches him with
    ↓
Nahida (Customer in Dhaka) who needs tomatoes
    ↓
Direct sale: Rahim gets ৳28/kg (instead of ৳15 from middleman)
Nahida pays ৳32/kg (instead of ৳55 at market)
Everyone wins! 🎉
```

### 2. 🌱 Smart Land Analysis - Know What to Plant

**What it does:**
AI analyzes your land and tells you exactly which crops will grow best and make the most profit.

<img width="1067" height="766" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-29 000806" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67a7b6ed-6d14-4f27-87c5-6319e4673d3e" />

**How it works:**
- Take a photo of your land or enter your location
- AI checks: soil type, weather patterns, water availability, past harvest data
- Get personalized recommendations

**What you'll learn:**
- 🌾 **Best crops for your soil** - "Your soil is perfect for rice and jute"
- 💧 **Water needs** - "This crop needs watering every 3 days"
- 📅 **Best planting time** - "Plant between January 15-30 for maximum yield"
- 💰 **Profit prediction** - "Growing tomatoes can earn you ৳45,000 this season"
- ⚠️ **Warnings** - "Avoid planting potatoes - soil pH too high"

**Benefits:**
- 📈 **25-40% higher yields** by choosing right crops
- 💸 **Save money** on crops that won't grow well
- 🎓 **Learn about your land** without expensive soil tests
- 🌍 **Climate-smart choices** - adapt to changing weather

**Example Report:**
```
📍 Your Location: Tangail, Bangladesh
🌡️ Climate: Hot & humid, moderate rainfall
🏞️ Soil Type: Clay loam (good for rice, jute)

✅ BEST CROPS FOR YOU:
1. Rice (Boro) - 95% success rate, ৳52,000 expected profit

### 3. 📊 Demand Forecasting - See What Buyers Want

**How it works:**
- Analyzes national market data, buyer searches, restaurant orders, export trends
- Shows you demand predictions for the next 3-6 months
- Suggests what to plant now to earn maximum profit later

**What you'll see:**
- 🔥 **High demand crops** - "Tomatoes will be in high demand next month - price expected ৳60/kg"
- 📉 **Low demand warning** - "Too many farmers growing potatoes - price may drop"
- 🌍 **Export opportunities** - "Mango demand high in Middle East - consider growing export-quality"
- 🏙️ **City-wise demand** - "Dhaka needs more leafy vegetables, Chittagong needs more fish"

**Benefits:**
- 🎯 **Plant what sells** - no more guessing
- 💰 **Better prices** - sell when demand is high
- 📦 **Plan ahead** - know what to plant 6 months in advance
- 🌾 **Reduce waste** - don't grow crops nobody wants

**Example Dashboard:**
```
NATIONAL DEMAND FORECAST - Next 3 Months

🔴 VERY HIGH DEMAND (Plant Now!):
- Tomatoes (৳55-65/kg expected)
